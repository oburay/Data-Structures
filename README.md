# **Data Structures**

## **Description**

This repository provides well-structured and efficient implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures, along with accompanying algorithms. The goal of this project is to offer both practical examples and theoretical insight into how these data structures work and how they can be used to solve complex problems in real-world applications.

### **Inspiration**

The primary inspiration for this project comes from **William Fiset's Data Structures Playlist** on YouTube, which serves as an excellent educational resource for understanding and implementing various data structures. You can find his playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsB6SWUrDFW2RmDotAfPbeHu).

I will gradually release code for each of the data structures covered in the playlist, with added emphasis on optimization, performance, and best practices.

## **Key Features**

- **Dynamic Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly & Doubly Linked)
- **Stacks & Queues** (Array-based & Linked List-based)
- **Hash Tables** (with advanced collision handling)
- **Binary Search Trees** (BST, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)
- **Heaps** (Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Priority Queue)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency Matrix/List, DFS/BFS, Shortest Path Algorithms)
- **Tries** (Prefix Trees for fast string operations)
- **Self-Balancing Trees** (for efficient searching and sorting)

## **Planned Releases**

I intend to release the code for each data structure progressively. Currently, the repository is being updated regularly, with the following release plan:

1. **Basic Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues)
2. **Advanced Trees** (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees)
3. **Heaps & Priority Queues**
4. **Graphs and Graph Algorithms**
5. **Tries and Prefix Trees**
6. **Optimization & Real-World Use Cases**

Please check back for updates as more implementations are added. Contributions are welcome!

## **About Me**

This repository is maintained by Obu Raymond. I am a **CS graduate student at Stanford** specializing in **Computer Networks and Security**. I have a deep passion for computer science, with a particular focus on solving complex problems in systems, networks, and security. As part of my academic journey, I regularly engage in algorithmic problem-solving and programming challenges to enhance my skills.

The knowledge I gain in the field of data structures is crucial for both **security** (e.g., cryptography, hashing, and optimization) and **software engineering** (e.g., designing scalable, high-performance applications), I aim to continuously improve my problem-solving techniques, stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in computer science, and build a solid foundation for tackling real-world technical challenges using advanced data structures.

I believe that strong foundations in data structures and system security are essential for building resilient, high-performance applications. This repository represents my commitment to improving my software engineering skills, and I hope my contributions can be helpful to others who are also learning and growing in the field.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or reach out if you have any questions!
